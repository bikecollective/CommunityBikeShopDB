<p class="yb_heading3red">Bike Registration was Successful!</p>
<p>
<strong>To prevent your new bike from getting stolen:</strong>
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>NEVER leave your bike out at night. Porches, back yards, and sheds are not safe. 
<li>NEVER use a cable lock or chain. (They are EASY to cut, even the thick ones.) 
<li>NEVER use a lock with a cylindrical key. (How to use a bic pen as a replacement key?) 
<li>ALWAYS lock up with a u-lock that uses a flat key. 
<li>ALWAYS register your bike at your local fire department. 
<li>ALWAYS record your serial numbers. Without serial numbers a police report is worthless. 
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<strong>NOTE:</strong> If you *find* an abandoned bike, the proper thing to do is report it to the Salt Lake City police department and have them pick it up. Sadly it is probably stolen, most commonly a thief just used it for a quick errand before ditching it -- so the real owner didn't leave it there and has no idea where it is. When you report a found bike to the police you give the owner has a chance of getting it back, and if it truly was abandoned the SLC Bike Collective will get the bike from the SLCPD 90 days later anyway.</p>
